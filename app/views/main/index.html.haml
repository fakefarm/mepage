      %h2 About me.
      .about-pic=image_tag 'me.jpg'
      %p I live in Boulder with my wife (Dana√©), my two sons (Oscar & Wells), and Marty (dog). Living in Boulder feels like living in the Shire from the Hobbit because it's small, quaint, and beautiful. I enjoy spending my time with my family, learning to program, building businesses, and getting outdoors as much as possible.

      %h2 Afterburners CD Exchange Club.
      %p I started a club with 2 other friends. We made a mix and the album cover artwork. We ended up making 71 albums. It was the way I learned of new music for nearly 7 years.
